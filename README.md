# DESIGN-OF-CONTROL-SYSTEM-USING-BODE-PLOTS
- This project aims at developing a control system for the given transfer function of a plant using Bode Plots. Thus, the project involves designing the control system parameters for required time domain & Bode specifications, writing a MATLAB script and building a mathematical model for simulation of the system. The control system is designed using Bode plots with step-by-step approach until the specifications are met.
- In this project, first of all we have analyzed the open loop system in order to gain the information of performance characteristics.Then, we have designed the lead compensator as a controller.
- As per the initial design, again the changes are made in order to reach the desired specifications.
- Root locus and Nyquist plot is presented in order to co-relate the design with Bode plot.
- After observing the performances meeting the specification, we have analyzed the sensor latency for system instability.
- Finally, the sensor latency analysis done through simulation is verified using Bode plots.
